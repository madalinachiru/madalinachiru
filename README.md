Hi there! I'm Madalina, an enthusiastic Junior Tester eager to kickstart my career in software testing. Having completed a course in software testing, I've acquired skills in creating test cases and bug reports using TestRail, conducting API Testing with Postman, and performing database testing using SQL. My main goal is to learn more and grow in a dynamic work environment, so I can identify my path in this new field.

Over the past four months, I've participated at a program at my current organization that has provided me the opportunity to practice my skills and gain insights into various aspects of the industry.
